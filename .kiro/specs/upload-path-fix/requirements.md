# Requirements Document

## Introduction
node is in d:\nvs\node\24.7.0\x64
This feature addresses a critical bug in the file upload system where individual file uploads with `webkitRelativePath` create duplicate folder structures. For example, uploading a single file `rapport.pdf` to the `documents` folder results in the incorrect path `documents/documents/rapport.pdf` instead of the expected `documents/rapport.pdf`. This issue occurs when browsers set `webkitRelativePath` for individual file uploads, causing the system to incorrectly classify them as folder uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading individual files to a specific folder, I want the files to be stored in the correct location without duplicate folder names, so that I can find my files in the expected directory structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a single file to a destination folder AND the file has webkitRelativePath set THEN the system SHALL ignore webkitRelativePath and use only the filename
2. WHEN the system processes an individual file upload THEN the system SHALL NOT create duplicate folder segments in the destination path
3. WHEN a file is uploaded with webkitRelativePath containing the same folder name as the destination THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent path duplication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user uploading entire folders, I want the folder structure to be preserved correctly, so that my files maintain their original organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads multiple files as part of a folder structure THEN the system SHALL use webkitRelativePath to preserve the folder hierarchy
2. WHEN the system detects a legitimate folder upload THEN the system SHALL maintain the complete relative path structure
3. WHEN processing folder uploads THEN the system SHALL distinguish between real folder uploads and individual files with misleading webkitRelativePath

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the upload system, I want robust path duplication detection, so that edge cases are handled automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system constructs a file path THEN the system SHALL analyze the path segments for consecutive duplicates
2. IF path duplication is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically use the basename fallback strategy
3. WHEN analyzing paths for duplication THEN the system SHALL ignore legitimate repeated folder names that are not consecutive
4. WHEN the destination folder path contains segments that match parts of webkitRelativePath THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent redundant path construction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the file sharing system, I want the upload behavior to be consistent and predictable, so that I can rely on files being stored where I expect them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files to any destination folder THEN the system SHALL produce consistent path construction logic
2. WHEN the system encounters edge cases in webkitRelativePath THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to safe path construction
3. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing upload functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of path construction decisions, so that I can troubleshoot upload issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes path construction decisions THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning and chosen strategy
2. WHEN path duplication is detected THEN the system SHALL log the detection and corrective action taken
3. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient debug information for troubleshooting
