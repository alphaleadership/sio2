# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core path analysis components





  - Create `lib/upload/` directory structure for path analysis modules
  - Implement `DuplicationDetector` class with consecutive and user pattern detection methods
  - Write unit tests for duplication detection algorithms
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Implement path construction strategies




  - Create `PathConstructionStrategy` class with basename, webkit, and smart path methods
  - Implement fallback logic for each strategy type
  - Add path validation and sanitization functions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_




- [x] 3. Build upload analysis engine










  - Implement `PathAnalysisEngine` class to classify upload types

  - Create logic to distinguish individual files from folder uploads
  - Add confidence scoring for upload type detection
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Create main path resolver orchestrator



  - Implement `UploadPathResolver` class that coordinates all components
  - Integrate duplication detection with path construction strategies

  - Add comprehensive logging for path construction decisions

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Integrate with existing FileStorageMiddleware








  - Modify `FileStorageMiddleware.js` to use the new path resolution system
  - Replace existing path construction logic with `UploadPathResolver`
  - Ensure backward compatibility with compression functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 1.1, 1.2_
- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling




- [ ] 6. Add comprehensive error handling


  - Implement graceful fallback strategies for path construction failures
  - Add detailed error logging with path construction reasoning
  - Create error recovery mechanisms for filesystem operations


 - _Requirements: 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Create integration tests for upload scenarios






  - Write tests for individual file uploads with problematic webkitRelativePath
  - Test legitimate folder uploads to ensure they still work correctly

  - Create tests for edge cases like multiple level duplications
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 8. Add performance monitoring and optimization






  - Implement performance benchmarks for path resol

ution operations
  - Add caching for repeated path analysis patterns
  - Optimize string operations for path manipulation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Update existing upload route integration

  - Ensure the upload route in `routes/index.js` works with new path resolution
  - Test integration with multer file processing
  - Verify compatibility with user authentication and folder permissions
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite

  - Write unit tests for all new path analysis components
  - Create integration tests covering the complete upload flow
  - Add regression tests to prevent future path duplication issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_
