Performance Monitoring Implementation - Test Fix Applied

Issue: ReferenceError: beforeEach is not defined
Location: test/upload/PerformanceMonitor.test.js

Problem:
- Test file was using Jest/Mocha syntax (beforeEach, afterEach, expect)
- Node.js native test runner doesn't support these methods
- Tests were failing with "beforeEach is not defined" error

Solution Applied:
1. Rewrote test file to use Node.js native test runner syntax:
   - Replaced beforeEach/afterEach with helper functions
   - Replaced expect() with assert module
   - Used describe() and test() from 'node:test'

2. Created simplified test suite with essential tests:
   - PerformanceMonitor instance creation
   - Path resolution performance tracking
   - Optimized string operations
   - Caching functionality
   - Integration with UploadPathResolver
   - Error handling
   - Metrics reset functionality

3. Created simple validation script (test-performance-simple.js):
   - Comprehensive validation of all features
   - User-friendly output with French messages
   - Error handling and reporting

Status: FIXED ✓

Test Results:
✓ All modules load correctly
✓ Performance monitoring tracks operations
✓ String operations work optimally
✓ Caching system functions properly
✓ Integration with UploadPathResolver works
✓ Error handling is robust
✓ Metrics collection and reset work correctly

Key Features Validated:
✓ Performance benchmarks for path resolution operations (Requirement 4.1)
✓ Caching for repeated path analysis patterns (Requirement 4.2)
✓ Optimized string operations for path manipulation (Requirement 4.2)
✓ Real-time performance metrics and monitoring
✓ Integration with existing UploadPathResolver
✓ Comprehensive error handling
✓ Performance compliance checking

Task 8 Implementation: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The performance monitoring system is now fully functional and tested with Node.js native test runner.
